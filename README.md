# BitBurner Scripts
Here's a collection of scripts I've amassed during my play-time.

Below are some things I think you'll be most interested in.

## Quality of life

- `/qol/make-tabs-scrollable.js` This script will allow you to scroll horizontally through your text-editor's opened tabs using the mouse wheel.

- `/qol/make-boxes-minimisable.js` This script will allow you to minimise the game's modals (Active Scripts etc.) by double-clicking the title.

Quality of life scripts need running once to activate; they will end immediately, freeing up RAM, but continue to function.
